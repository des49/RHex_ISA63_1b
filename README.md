# RHex_ISA63_1b
 Mechatronic design, dynamic modeling and control of six legged robot 

The RHex is a bio-inspired six-legged machine with one actuator for each leg. The legs could completely turn around, so itâ€™s movement was similar to a wheeled robot. Despite its mechanical simplicity the robot could run, turn, jump, climb stairs, and do a backflip.
The walking algorithm, motor control and the complete mechanical simulations is done in SimMechanics environment with the imported CAD model. With the help of the simulation we can optimize the walking algorithm, the energy losses, and the control parameters.
